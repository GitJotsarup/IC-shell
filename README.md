# ICSH

This is basically a project where I have created a working shell with commands such as sh, echo, !!, rerouting, signals and more.

Script mode only works if you input the file as a argv 2.
Basically when you run the file, do:
./icsh test.sh

and then it will run the contents of test.sh line by line

Other than that everything works well!
