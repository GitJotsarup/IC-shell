# ICSH

Script mode only works if you input the file as a argv 2.
Basically when you run the file, do:
./icsh test.sh

and then it will run the contents of test.sh line by line

Other than that everything is there except the last bit of milestone 2. for a additional features ive added them all into a function and commented them out.
